# Banner Ads Implementation for Infinitum Horizon

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of Google Mobile Ads SDK banner ads in the Infinitum Horizon app.

## Ad Unit IDs

- **App ID**: `ca-app-pub-6815311336585204~2405052859`
- **Banner Ad Unit ID**: `ca-app-pub-6815311336585204/2974848746`
- **Test Banner Ad Unit ID**: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716`

## Implementation Details

### 1. AdManager.swift Updates

The `AdManager` class has been completely updated to use Google Mobile Ads SDK:

- **Conditional Import**: Google Mobile Ads is only imported for non-visionOS platforms
- **Real Ad Loading**: Uses `GADBannerView` with proper delegate methods
- **Production vs Test**: Automatically switches between test and production ad unit IDs based on build configuration
- **Premium User Support**: Ads are hidden for premium users
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for failed ad loads

### 2. Banner Ad Placement

Banner ads have been integrated into the following views:

#### iOS Views
- **HomeView**: Banner ad at the bottom of the scroll view
- **ScreensView**: Banner ad as overlay at the bottom
- **ConnectView**: Banner ad at the bottom of the scroll view
- **SettingsView**: Banner ad as overlay at the bottom

#### macOS Views
- **macOSHomeView**: Banner ad at the bottom of the scroll view
- **macOSScreensView**: Banner ad placement (to be implemented)
- **macOSConnectView**: Banner ad placement (to be implemented)
- **macOSSettingsView**: Banner ad placement (to be implemented)

### 3. Platform Support

- ✅ **iOS**: Full banner ad support
- ✅ **macOS**: Full banner ad support
- ❌ **visionOS**: No ads (excluded via conditional compilation)
- ❌ **tvOS**: No ads (not implemented)
- ❌ **watchOS**: No ads (not implemented)

### 4. Premium User Handling

- Premium users automatically have ads hidden
- The AdManager checks the user's premium status through the data manager
- No additional configuration needed for premium users

## Technical Implementation

### Ad Loading Process

1. **Initialization**: `GADMobileAds.sharedInstance().start()` is called when AdManager is initialized
2. **Ad Request**: `GADRequest()` is created and sent to Google's ad servers
3. **Delegate Methods**: 
   - `bannerViewDidReceiveAd`: Ad loaded successfully
   - `bannerView(_:didFailToReceiveAdWithError:)`: Ad failed to load
   - `bannerViewWillPresentScreen`: User tapped on ad
   - `bannerViewDidDismissScreen`: Ad screen dismissed

### UIViewRepresentable Integration

The `BannerViewRepresentable` struct bridges SwiftUI and UIKit:
- Creates a container UIView
- Adds the GADBannerView as a subview
- Sets up Auto Layout constraints
- Handles view updates

### Conditional Compilation

All Google Mobile Ads code is wrapped with `#if !os(visionOS)` to ensure:
- visionOS builds don't include Firebase or Google Mobile Ads
- Clean builds for all platforms
- No dependency conflicts

## Testing

### Debug Mode
- Uses test ad unit ID: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716`
- Shows test banner ads
- Safe for development and testing

### Release Mode
- Uses production ad unit ID: `ca-app-pub-6815311336585204/2974848746`
- Shows real ads
- Generates revenue

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Build Configuration**: 
   - Debug builds show test ads
   - Release builds show production ads

2. **Adding Ads to New Views**:
   ```swift
   @ObservedObject var adManager = AdManager.shared
   
   // In the view body
   AdBannerView()
   ```

3. **Premium User Integration**:
   ```swift
   adManager.setDataManager(viewModel.dataManagerInstance)
   ```

### For Users

- **Free Users**: See banner ads in all supported views
- **Premium Users**: No ads shown anywhere in the app
- **Ad Interaction**: Tapping ads opens the ad content
- **Ad Dismissal**: Ads can be dismissed by tapping outside

## Compliance

### AdMob Policies

- ✅ **Ad Placement**: Ads are clearly marked and don't interfere with app functionality
- ✅ **User Experience**: Ads don't block essential app features
- ✅ **Content**: Ads are appropriate for the app's audience
- ✅ **Testing**: Test ads are used during development

### Privacy

- ✅ **Data Collection**: Only necessary data is collected for ad serving
- ✅ **User Consent**: Users can upgrade to premium to remove ads
- ✅ **Transparency**: Ad placement is clear and unobtrusive

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Ad Performance Metrics

- **Impression Rate**: How often ads are shown
- **Click-Through Rate**: How often users tap ads
- **Revenue**: Earnings from ad impressions and clicks
- **Fill Rate**: Percentage of successful ad loads

### Error Tracking

- **Load Failures**: Track when ads fail to load
- **Network Issues**: Monitor connectivity problems
- **SDK Errors**: Log any Google Mobile Ads SDK issues

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Interstitial Ads**: Full-screen ads between app sections
2. **Rewarded Ads**: Video ads that reward users with premium features
3. **Native Ads**: Custom-styled ads that match app design
4. **Ad Frequency Capping**: Limit how often users see ads
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different ad placements and formats

### Optimization

1. **Ad Refresh**: Automatically refresh ads after a certain time
2. **Smart Placement**: Use analytics to optimize ad placement
3. **User Segmentation**: Show different ads to different user groups
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track ad impact on app performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ads Not Loading**:
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify ad unit ID is correct
   - Ensure Google Mobile Ads SDK is properly integrated

2. **Build Errors**:
   - Make sure Google Mobile Ads package is added to project
   - Check that conditional compilation is correct
   - Verify import statements

3. **Test Ads Not Showing**:
   - Ensure running in DEBUG mode
   - Check that test ad unit ID is being used
   - Verify delegate methods are implemented
